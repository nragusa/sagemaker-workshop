# Distributed Training with TensorFlow 

In this lab we will be using images of handwritten digits from the [MNIST Database](http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/) to demonstrate how to perform distributed training using SageMaker. Using a convolutional neural network model based on the [TensorFlow MNIST Example](https://github.com/tensorflow/models/tree/master/official/mnist), we will demonstrate how to use a Jupyter notebook and the [SageMaker Python SDK](https://github.com/aws/sagemaker-python-sdk) to create your own script to pre-process data, train a model, create a SageMaker hosted endpoint, and make predictions against this endpoint. The model will predict what the handwritten digit is in the image presented for prediction. Besides demonstrating a "bring your own script" for TensorFlow use case, the example also showcases how easy it is to set up a cluster of multiple instances for model training in SageMaker.

1. In your notebook instance, click the **New** button on the right and select **Folder**.
2. Click the checkbox next to your new folder, click the **Rename** button above in the menu bar, and give the folder a name such as 'tensorflow-distributed'.
3. Click the folder to enter it.
4. To upload the notebook, click the **Upload** button on the right. Then in the file selection popup, select the file 'TensorFlow_Distributed_MNIST.ipynb' from the notebooks subdirectory in the folder on your computer where you downloaded this GitHub repository. Click the blue **Upload** button that appears to the right of the notebook's file name.
5. You are now ready to begin the notebook:  click the notebook's file name to open it, then follow the directions in the notebook.

<p><strong>NOTE:  training the model for this example typically takes about 8 minutes.</strong></p>
